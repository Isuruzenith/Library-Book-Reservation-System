## Project Description

The Library Book Reservation System is a comprehensive web-based application designed to streamline the management of library resources and enhance the user experience for both library administrators and students. This modern system leverages Java Servlets, JSP, and MySQL to provide a robust platform for book management and reservation.

## Core Functionality

### For Administrators
Administrators have full control over the library's digital infrastructure. They can:
- Add new books to the system
- Manage existing book records
- Oversee all reservations
- Access a centralized dashboard with inventory and reservation status
- View detailed book information and manage user reservations

### For Students
Students benefit from an intuitive interface that allows them to:
- Search for books by title
- View book availability in real-time
- Reserve available books with a few clicks
- Access a dashboard displaying current reservations and search functionality

## Technical Implementation

The application follows a structured MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture:

- **Model Layer**: Contains data objects (Book, User, Reservation) representing core entities.
- **DAO Layer**: Implements data access objects for database operations, separating business logic and data persistence.
- **Controller Layer**: Manages user requests via servlets that process form submissions and direct users to views.
- **View Layer**: Uses JSP pages styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design.

## User Interface

The system features a visually appealing interface with:
- A modern dashboard tailored to user roles
- Comprehensive book listings with status indicators
- Instant search functionality
- Responsive design for seamless use across devices
- Visual feedback for user actions (success/error messages)

## Database Structure

The system uses a MySQL database with tables for users, books, and reservations, ensuring data integrity and efficient querying of book availability and reservation status.

## Security Features

- Role-based access control to restrict features by user role
- Session management for secure user authentication

## Benefits

The Library Book Reservation System improves library operations by:
1. Reducing manual workload for staff
2. Enabling student self-service
3. Minimizing errors in book tracking and reservations
4. Providing real-time book availability
5. Enhancing the library experience with a user-friendly interface

This system balances functionality and aesthetics, making it an ideal solution for educational institutions modernizing library management.
